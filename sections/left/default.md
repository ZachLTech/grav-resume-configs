I'm Zach, a passionate computer science enthusiast currently dually enrolled studying CS @ FAU. With a love for innovation and technology, I've explored everything from 3D printing and virtual machines to web development and server management. My journey has been filled with exciting projects and continuous learning, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skills as I've found myself to be a quick learner who enjoys the process of creating new things.
